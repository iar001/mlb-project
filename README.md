Play MLB Baseball

 by Ian Rappaport


Project Purpose

The purpose of this website/app is to use React and React Router for the user to pick their team and play a simulated baseball game against the opponent.  The quality of the players will depend on statistics from the MLB APi, which is a great resource for current and historical MLB statistics.  The user will form their team by inputting their players, and then will play against one of the 30 current MLB teams.  


APIs

I am using the MLB API, which is free and has a tremendous database of statistics for teams, players and seasons.  I will use this data to determine the strength of each player. 

Features

The homepage will have an explanation on how to use the site, and the ability to pick the user's team.  The user will type in different players and add them to their roster until they have 9 and a pitcher.  Once this has been created, the user will click submit, and be taken to another page where the game will take place.
