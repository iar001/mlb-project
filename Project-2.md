Play MLB Baseball

 by Ian Rappaport


Project Purpose

The purpose of this website/app is to use React and React Router for the user to pick baseball players and have their statistics display.  It should be a quick way for users to see information of a player they are interested in.  Once this MVP is accomplished, additional features like assembling a team and performing a simulation vs another team can be done. 



APIs

I am using the MLB API, which is free and has a tremendous database of statistics for teams, players and seasons.  I will use this information to display the data onto the page.

Features

The site will allow the user to pick a player, and display the player's statistics on the page.  It will show around 10 of the most important stats to show how good a player is. 

There will be two options.  For the player to search for their own player, or to select a player from a list of best players in the league.  

Also, there will be two pages.  One for pitching and one for hitting, as there are different statistics that must be display for each.

Stretch Goals

Once you are able to select hitters and pitchers, I would like the user to be able to select an entire lineup.  Then, based on the player's stats, show projections of runs and wins for a full season.
